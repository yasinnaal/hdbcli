# Introducing hdbcli SAP HANA Python Client

##### Connecting SAP HANA DB using python Language

The SAP HANA client supports Python 3.4 and later and Python 2.7.

The Python Database API Specification v2.0 (PEP 249) defines a set of methods that provides a consistent database interface independent of the actual database being used. The Python extension module for SAP HANA implements PEP 249. Once you install the module, you can access and change the information in databases from Python. In PEP 249, autocommit is turned off by default. In the SAP HANA Python driver, autocommit is turned on by default.
