# Introducing hdbcli SAP HANA Python Client

##### Connecting SAP HANA DB using python Language

The SAP HANA client supports Python 3.4 and later and Python 2.7.

The Python Database API Specification v2.0 (PEP 249) defines a set of methods that provides a consistent database interface independent of the actual database being used. The Python extension module for SAP HANA implements PEP 249. Once you install the module, you can access and change the information in databases from Python. In PEP 249, autocommit is turned off by default. In the SAP HANA Python driver, autocommit is turned on by default.

## Install the Python Driver
######  you can use the Python driver to connect to an SAP HANA database.
Install the Python driver into your local Python environment by using the pip installer so that you can use the Python driver to connect to an SAP HANA database.

## Prerequisites
You have run the SAP HANA client install.

## Procedure
- 1. If you have multiple Python environments, then activate the Python environment where you want to install the Python driver. If you donâ€™t have multiple Python environments, then ignore this step.
- 2. Run the install:

#### UNIX, Linux, and macOS
Use one of the following install methods:

pip install
```
pip install /usr/sap/hdbclient/hdbcli-N.N.N.tar.gz
```

easy_install
```
pip install /usr/sap/hdbclient/hdbcli-N.N.N.tar.gz
```

disutils installer
```
tar -xf hdbcli-N.N.N.tar.gz
```

Then run:
```
cd hdbcli-N.N.N
```

Lastly, run:
```
setup.py install
```


```
from hdbcli import dbapi
conn = dbapi.connect(
    address="<hostname>",
    port=3<NN>MM,
    user="<username>",

cursor = conn.cursor()
```
